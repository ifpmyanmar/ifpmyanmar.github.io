                    Project Designing Activities and Farewell - This is the last day of the conference and the delegates will finally engage in an exciting yet most significant part of the conference. The delegates will be split into 6 groups who will all be given a short presentation on how to design a project or a business model after which the delegates will be allowed
                         an hour to start designing their desired project. They will then be allowed 10 minutes each to pitch these projects and after the conference, these ideas will become the actual follow-up projects.
                          So our conference will be spawning at least another 6 follow-up impacts that will then branch out into definitely bigger causes that are worth supporting. IfP Myanmar 2018 conference will then end victoriously and 
                          impactfully on 1pm sharp.

                    <h4>Day 1</h4>
                    <p>
                        activities will benefit the delegates who have not ever been into a medium crowd or a networking session. The delegates will foster self-confidence and this is especially an effective day for the delegates who have been marginalized due to their social context since everybody will be seen as equals and everybody will become a big family on the days onwards.

                    <h4>Day 2</h4>
                    <p>
                        activities will especially benefit the delegates who have been feeling significant at some point in their lives due to either self-doubts or socio-economic background because the activities on this day will allow the delegates to empower and inspire each other, leading all of them to become fully able to share their inspiring stories. This day is also very important because the delegates will be able to identify their leadership capacity that will be put to use in their future.

                    <h4>Day 3</h4>
                    <p>
                        activities will benefit people with unique identities like the women from oppressed communities, people from underprivileged backgrounds and individuals with different sexual orientations (LGBTQ) because on this day, the conference will serve as a positive and common ground for all people who can bravely step up and share about their stories and seek out for comfort and encouragement. This day will be the day when the delegates start to feel truthful and proud of themselves for being who they are and use their unique identities as a leverage to inspire and benefit other people after the conference.

                <h4>Day 4</h4>
                <p>
                    will be the day when the delegates will eventually feel that they can make an actual impact in the community. The pride and the satisfaction they will feel from the service day introduced on this particular day will be like nothing else. This is also the day when the delegates will meet other beneficiaries and deliver workshops for them. So this is going to be the first step for the delegates, including those marginalized or treated differently, to realize that they also can make changes as equally as everybody else. 
                </p>

                <h4>Day 5</h4>
                <p>
                    activities will allow the delegates to reflect about their own communities they grew up or live in and imagine the changes they can make for these communities. This is a day that can mean a huge impact not just for the delegates but also for the communities because the delegates are ready to visualize their own societies and identify the challenges that these societies face and brainstorm the solutions to them. So in short, these activities are very beneficial to those who want to make impactful changes but are never given a chance to even think about it because of being marginalized.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-4">
                <img src="./IMG_0573.JPG" alt="" class="img-fluid">
                <h4>Day 6</h4>
                <p>
                    activities will finally bid farewell to the delegates as they take away loads of knowledge and experiences about how to come the real community leaders. By the time the delegates leave the conference room on this final day,  they will feel the energy to make changes in their own communities and people who think they are marginalized will become empowered more than ever. They will start to evolve into courageous leaders who will act differently and powerfully to make changes in various regions.
